            <value>Seven deadly sins 
Seven ways to win 
Seven holy paths to hell 
And your trip begins 

Seven downward slopes 
Seven bloodied hopes 
Seven are your burning fires 
Seven your desires... 

I am he the bornless one 
The fallen angel watching you 
Babylon, the scarlet whore 
I'll infiltrate your gratitude 
Don't you dare to save your son 
Kill him now and save the young ones 
Be the mother of a birth strangled babe 
Be the devils own, Lucifer's my name 

Moonchild - hear the mandrake scream 
Moonchild - open the seventh seal 

I count the heads of those unborn 
The accursed ones I'll find them all 
And if you die by your own hand 
As a suicide you shall be damned 
And if you try to save your soul 
I will torment you - you shall not grow old 
With every second and passing breath 
You'll be so alone your soul will bleed to death 

Moonchild - hear the mandrake scream 
Moonchild - open the seventh seal 
Moonchild - You'll be mine soon child 
Moonchild - take my hand tonight 

The twins they are exhausted, seven is this night 
Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite 
Seven angels seven demons battle for his soul 
When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die 

(Kick ass guitar) 

One more dies and one more lives 
One baby cries one mother grieves 
For all the sins you will commit 
You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give 
A web of fear shall be your coat 
To clothe you in the night 
A lucky escape for you young man 
For I'll see you damned in endless night 

Moonchild - hear the mandrake scream 
Moonchild - open the seventh seal 
Moonchild - You'll be mine soon child 
Moonchild - take my hand tonight</value>
