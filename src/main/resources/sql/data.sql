"Where do I take this pain of mine?
I run, but it stays right by my side

So tear me open, pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps

Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays
Now it stays

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, so hold me
Until it sleeps

So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip,
don't want your greed
Don't want it

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me until it sleeps

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, holds you,
holds you until it sleeps

I don't want it

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me till I'm clean

I'll tear me open,
make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps
Until it sleeps"),

"Hey, I'm feeling tired
My time, is gone today
You flirt with suicide
Sometimes, that's ok
Hear what others say
I'm here, standing hollow
Falling away from me
Falling away from me

Day, is here fading
That's when, I would say
I flirt with suicide
Sometimes kill the pain
I can always say
'It's gonna be better tomorrow'
Falling away from me
Falling away from me

Beating me down
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground
Screaming some sound
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground

(Falling away from me)
It's spinning round and round
(Falling away from me)
It's lost and can't be found
(Falling away from me)
It's spinning round and round
(Falling away from me)
So down

Beating me down
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground
Screaming some sound
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground

Pressing me, they won't go away
So I pray, go away
It's falling away from me

Beating me down
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground
Screaming some sound
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground"),

"She heard this song before
Daddy's at the door
Just to say I love you

Please, please, don't let him in
Is it all beginning again tonight?
Somebody make it right!

I say: Give her the gun!
Look at him run away
Give her the gun
Before the next one comes along
And doesn't pay

He, dragged into the cold
Momma sold her soul
For one more ride to heaven

Please, someone let him in
Is it all beginning again tonight
Can anyone make it right?

I say: Give him the gun!
Look at her run away
Oh, give him the gun
Before the next one comes along
And doesn't pay

Simply unforgivable, destruction of the heart
Does anybody tell
Make yourself invisible
Be blinded by the light
We're hiding away, what would they say
Yeah

She played this song before
Daddy's at the door
Just to say hello, ahh
Now, in a different world
Is it all beginning again tonight
Oh, I got to make it right
I say: give her the gun
Look at him run away
Oh, give her the gun
Before the next one comes along

Give her the gun
Look at him falling down
Oh, give her the gun
Before the next one comes along
'Cause it goes round and round and round..."),

"Can you remember remember my name 
As I flow through your life 
A thousand oceans I have flown 
And cold spirits of ice 
All my life 
I am the echo of your past 

I am returning the echo of a point in time 
Distant faces shine 
A thousand warriors I have known 
And laughing as the spirits appear 
All your life 
Shadows of another day 

And if you hear me talking on the wind 
You've got to understand 
We must remain 
Perfect Strangers 

I know I must remain inside this silent 
well of sorrow 

A strand of silver hanging through the 
sky 
Touching more than you see 
The voice of ages in your mind 
Is aching with the dead of the night 
Precious life (your tears are lost in 
falling rain) 

And if you hear me talking on the wind 
You've got to understand 
We must remain 
Perfect Strangers"),

"Said, I've been around the world
Wrote a million songs, it's all a bore to me
I've slept in the gutter and I've lied with the dogs
It never bothered me

Said, the sheriff he come too with his little boys in blue
They been lookin' for me, child
But with my crystal sheen guitar, I'm another ego star
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, yeah, yeah

Get me to the stage, it brings me home again
This is Shangrila
I'm trippin' on it now, it brings me home again
This is Shangrila

Said, I look bad in shorts but most of us do
Don't let that bother me
I'm a [Incomprehensible] knows who and I don't believe in smack
So don't you die on me, babe, don't you die on me

'Cause love is all good people need
And music sets the sick ones free
Without love no one ever grows
Nothing will ever sing

Because this is Shangrila, honey
And you have gathered for the feast
My bread is your body, the wine is blood, child
The wine is blood, babe
The wine is, give it to me

Get me to the stage, it brings me home again
Sing it, this is Shangrila
I'm trippin' on it now, it brings me home again
This is Shangrila

Get me to the stage, it brings me home again
I'm trippin' on it now, it brings me home again");
